# Horiseon

## Description

Web accesibility is the practice of designing and developing websites and content that can be accessed and used by all individuals, regardless of any disability they may have. This includes individuals with visual, auditory, physical, or cognitive disabilities, as well as those who may be using assistive technologies such as screen readers or voice recognition software. The goal of this project is to remove barriers and provide equal access to information and online services that non-disabeled individuals can enjoy.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.


## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
